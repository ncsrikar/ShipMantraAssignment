The folder consists of both FRONTEND Written in Angular and Backend Written in NodeJS. 

Although I was supposed to create a simple webpage to get data from Borzo. I have decided to use Angular as frontend for it. 
It is possible to achive the same using 

NodeJS backend is communicating on Port 3000. Angular is communicating on the Port 4200. 

To run Backend => 
cd shipmantra_backend
node shipmantra.js


to run FrontEnd =>
cd shipmantra_frontend
ng serve -o
